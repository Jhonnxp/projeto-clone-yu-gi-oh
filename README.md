# Projeto Clone Yu-gi-oh
## <ul> <li> This project was based on the Yu-gi-oh cartoon cards, that aims to share information about the characters cartoon in a entertaining way. When scrolling through the cards you have the option of turning them upside-down (by clicking on them) simulating how usually the game is played. </li> </ul>

## How does the project works?!

## Deep Dive
Hello, and welcome to my very first project on this journey to become a developer! This project was idealized by the DEVemDOBRO on their "Semana do zero ao programador" which is a special and original event created in order to find those who have wanting to get into the programming world and just don't know how to (which basically described my previous situation). Alongside them I had my first interaction with coding, by developing this project.

## Personal Insights
Working on this project felt like a roller-coaster, there were highs and lows. Althought I had the right and excellent guidance, being honest I still felt a bit lost but filled with curiosity. I wanted to challenge myself, and throughout the project developing process I could see ideas turning into reality. That was my motivation! Getting to learn HTML was a piece of cake, in CSS I had a bit of a stretch and Js got me crying haha! Jokes aside, I'm happy with the outcome and happy to know that this is one the many projects I will still develop, so for the meantime I'll keep up the good work!
